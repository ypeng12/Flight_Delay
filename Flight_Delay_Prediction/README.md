## Abstract
Flights are said to be delayed when they arrive later than the scheduled arrival time. This delay is predominantly influenced by environmental conditions. Flight delay is vexatious for passengers and also incurs an agonizingly high financial loss to airlines and countries. A structured prediction system is an indispensable tool that can help aviation authorities effectively alleviate flight delays. This project aims to build a two-stage machine learning engine to effectively predict the arrival delay of a flight in minutes after departure based on real-time
flight and weather data. A classifier first predicts if the flight will be delayed or not and subsequently a regression model predicts the arrival delay in minutes if the flight is expected to be delayed.

## Result
The flight and weather data were combined into a single data set and pre-processed to train a two-stage machine learning model that predicts flight arrival delay. Due to class imbalance, there was an inherent bias towards the majority class, ’Not Delayed’ flights (class 0). The data was sampled using SMOTE before classification to overcome the bias. Out of five different algorithms, the Random Forest classifier gave the best F1 score (0.78) and Recall (0.74) for the delayed flights. Subsequently, the Random Forest regressor was pipe-lined, giving MAE 7.178 minutes and RMSE 11.283 minutes with an R2 score of 0.977. In conclusion, the flight delay prediction was efficient and the Machine Learning model exhibited good performance.
